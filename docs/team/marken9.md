## Summary of Contributions

**New Features**

  while skipping and reporting any invalid indexes
- Add ability to delete all marked tasks
  - Justification: The user can quickly remove all tasks that have been marked 
  as completed without deleting them one by one
  - Highlight: Supports deletion across todos, deadlines, and events, 
  providing consistent behavior for all task types
- Add ability to find tasks with the same substring
  - Justification: The user can find certain tasks quickly instead of scrolling through the list
  - Highlight: Searches across all categories, including todos, deadlines, and events
- Add priority level and sorting for todos

  - Highlight: Improves todo organisation within categories without requiring manual reordering
