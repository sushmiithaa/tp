**Project: UniTasker**

UniTasker is a desktop application used to keep track of tasks and courses.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Summary of Contributions

**New Features**

- Added the ability to set limit on end year
  - What it does: Allows user to manually set the end year. Any task that is added after the set year cannot be added to the list.
  - Justification: This gives the user the convenience of changing the end year whenever they want. For example if user wants to continue using the application after graduation for other personal use, they can simply extend the end year to a later date.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects all timed task that can be added in the future and gives room for the user to plat around with the settings. User settings are also saved after exit.
- Added the ability to set limit on number of timed task per day
  - What it does: Allows user to set the maximum task they want to put on each day. If there are too many timed tasks on a particular day, the system will show a message warning user.
  - Justification: As University students, there might be days when they might be overwhelmed with tasks. To prevent them from burning out, they are given an option to set a maximum number of timed tasks on a particular date. This is also a way of encouraging users not to procrastinate if there are many tasks to be done on a particular date.  
- Added ability to list out all deadlines within a certain date range using [STARTYEAR][ENDYEAR][/deadline]
  - What it does: Allows user to list out all deadlines within a certain date range.
  - Justification: This gives user a method to access all deadlines within a certain period. Shorten long list of timed task, providing ease of checking of deadlines only.
