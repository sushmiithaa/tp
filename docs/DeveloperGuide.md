## Design

### Architecture

![MainArchitecture]()

The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of the App

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

UniTasker is in charge of the app launch and shut down
- At app launch, it initializes the other components.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following components:
- Command: 
- UI:
- AppContainer:
- Storage:

**How the architecture components interact with each other:**

**AppContainer component**

The `AppContainer` consists of the following:

- `CategoryList categories` – stores all categories and their associated tasks (todos, deadlines, events)
- `Calendar calendar` – Manages the mapping of dates to tasks with date information (deadlines and events) ???
- `Storage storage` – handles saving and loading of data from local files
- `CourseParser courseParser` – processes course-related commands
- `int dailyTaskLimit` – defines the maximum number of tasks allowed per day
- `int startYear` – lower bound for valid date ranges
- `int endYear` – upper bound for valid date ranges

The `AppContainer` component,
- Stores all the information required for the application in a single object
- Enables commands to operate without directly depending on global/static variables

## Product scope
### Target user profile

University students who need to manage multiple courses, assignments, deadlines, and personal tasks simultaneously. 
These users often juggle academic responsibilities across different modules, each with varying deadlines, 
priorities, and schedules. They require a simple and efficient system to organise their tasks,
keep track of coursework, and stay on top of deadlines.

### Value proposition

University students often struggle to keep track of tasks and course assessments across different 
platforms such as learning portals, calendars and notes. This fragmented approach leads
to missed deadlines, poor prioritisation, and unnecessary stress. UniTasker provides a centralized 
task management solution that consolidates todos, deadlines, events and course information into a 
single platform. Through a simple command-line interface, it allows students to efficiently organise, 
update, and review their tasks and assessments. This helps students to stay on top of their workload
and focus on completing their academic responsibilities.
